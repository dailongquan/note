# 服务器端配置

sudo apt install easy-rsa
mkdir ~/easy-rsa
cp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/  ~/easy-rsa

nano vars

export KEY_COUNTRY="CN"
export KEY_PROVINCE="JS"
export KEY_CITY="Nanjing"
export KEY_ORG="njust"
export KEY_EMAIL="lqdai@foxmail.com"
export KEY_OU="server"

我们需要拷贝openssl配置。另外一个版本已经有现成的配置文件，如果你没有特定要求，你可以使用它的上一个版本。这里是1.0.0版本。

cp openssl-1.0.0.cnf openssl.cnf

我们需要加载环境变量，这些变量已经在前面一步中编辑好了。

source ./vars

生成密钥的最后一步准备工作是清空旧的证书和密钥，以及生成新密钥的序列号和索引文件。可以通过以下命令完成。
./clean-all

现在，我们完成了准备工作，准备好启动生成进程了。让我们先来生成证书。

./build-ca

接下来，我们需要生成一个服务器密钥

./build-key-server server

现在，我们已经有了证书和服务器密钥。下一步，就是去生成Diffie-Hellman密钥。

./build-dh

继续生成最后的密钥了，该密钥用于TLS验证。

openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key

最后，我们来创建OpenVPN配置

cp ~/easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt   /etc/openvpn/
cp ~/easy-rsa/keys/server.crt   /etc/openvpn/
cp ~/easy-rsa/keys/server.key   /etc/openvpn/
cp ~/easy-rsa/keys/dh2048.pem   /etc/openvpn/

nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf

```

# If you want to control access policies
# over the VPN, you must create firewall
# rules for the the TUN/TAP interface.
# On non-Windows systems, you can give
# an explicit unit number, such as tun0.
# On Windows, use "dev-node" for this.
# On most systems, the VPN will not function

# a unique Common Name for the server

# Configure server mode and supply a VPN subnet
# for OpenVPN to draw client addresses from.
# The server will take 10.8.0.1 for itself,
# the rest will be made available to clients.
# Each client will be able to reach the server
# on 10.8.0.1. Comment this line out if you are
# ethernet bridging. See the man page for more info.

# is restarted, reconnecting clients can be assigned
# the same virtual IP address from the pool that was
# previously assigned.

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging.
# You must first use your OS's bridging capability
# to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet
# NIC interface.  Then you must manually set the
# IP/netmask on the bridge interface, here we
# assume 10.8.0.4/255.255.255.0.  Finally we
# must set aside an IP range in this subnet
# (start=10.8.0.50 end=10.8.0.100) to allocate
# to connecting clients.  Leave this line commented
# out unless you are ethernet bridging.
;server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.50 10.8.0.100

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging
# using a DHCP-proxy, where clients talk
# to the OpenVPN server-side DHCP server
# to receive their IP address allocation
# and DNS server addresses.  You must first use
# your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP
# interface with the ethernet NIC interface.
# Note: this mode only works on clients (such as
# Windows), where the client-side TAP adapter is
# bound to a DHCP client.
;server-bridge

# Push routes to the client to allow it
# to reach other private subnets behind
# the server.  Remember that these
# private subnets will also need
# to know to route the OpenVPN client
# address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)
# back to the OpenVPN server.
;push "route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0"
;push "route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0"

# To assign specific IP addresses to specific
# clients or if a connecting client has a private
# subnet behind it that should also have VPN access,
# use the subdirectory "ccd" for client-specific
# configuration files (see man page for more info).

# EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
# having the certificate common name "Thelonious"
# also has a small subnet behind his connecting
# machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
# First, uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
#   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# This will allow Thelonious' private subnet to
# access the VPN.  This example will only work
# if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
# using "dev tun" and "server" directives.

# EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
# Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
# First uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252
# Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
#   ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2

# Suppose that you want to enable different
# firewall access policies for different groups
# of clients.  There are two methods:
# (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
#     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
#     for each group/daemon appropriately.
# (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
#     modify the firewall in response to access
#     from different clients.  See man
#     page for more info on learn-address script.
;learn-address ./script

# If enabled, this directive will configure
# all clients to redirect their default
# network gateway through the VPN, causing
# all IP traffic such as web browsing and
# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN
# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT
# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet
# in order for this to work properly).
;push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

# Certain Windows-specific network settings
# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS
# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:
# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats
# The addresses below refer to the public
# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"

# Uncomment this directive to allow different
# clients to be able to "see" each other.
# By default, clients will only see the server.
# To force clients to only see the server, you
# will also need to appropriately firewall the
# server's TUN/TAP interface.
;client-to-client

# Uncomment this directive if multiple clients
# might connect with the same certificate/key
# files or common names.  This is recommended
# only for testing purposes.  For production use,
# each client should have its own certificate/key
# pair.
#
# IF YOU HAVE NOT GENERATED INDIVIDUAL
# CERTIFICATE/KEY PAIRS FOR EACH CLIENT,
# EACH HAVING ITS OWN UNIQUE "COMMON NAME",
# UNCOMMENT THIS LINE OUT.
;duplicate-cn

# The keepalive directive causes ping-like
# messages to be sent back and forth over
# the link so that each side knows when
# the other side has gone down.
# Ping every 10 seconds, assume that remote
# peer is down if no ping received during
# a 120 second time period.

# For extra security beyond that provided
# by SSL/TLS, create an "HMAC firewall"
# to help block DoS attacks and UDP port flooding.

# 客户端配置

创建客户端密钥

./build-key client

如果需要密码保护密钥，你需要运行另外一个命令

./build-key-pass client

在此种情况下，在建立VPN连接时，会提示你输入密码。

现在，我们需要将以下文件从服务器拷贝到客户端/etc/openvpn/keys/文件夹。
服务器文件列表：
ca.crt,
client.crt,
client.key,
ta.key.

nano /etc/openvpn/client.conf
